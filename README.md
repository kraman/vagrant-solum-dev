# Solum Dev Environment with Vagrant

## About

The purpose of this Repo is to help you quickly set up a consistent development environment
for working on Solum.    It will deploy devstack and the solum repo and get everything started.

It is designed to be run with Vagrant/VirtualBox on your local desktop, but there is some experimental
support for using the Rackspace Cloud Provider.

## Prerequsites

* Vagrant 1.3.x  ( http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.3.5 )
* Virtualbox ( https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads )

__Vagrant Plugins ( in this order! )__

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
```

### Experimental Rackspace Cloud Support

__Vagrant Rackspace Provider__

* set environment variables
*  * `OS_USERNAME` `OS_PASSWORD` `PUBLIC_KEY` `PRIVATE_KEY`
* will use DFW performance 2gb servers.
* will firewall everything but port 22 ( ssh )

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-rackspace
```

## Using

### Devstack

#### Launching

__Devstack + Solum__

`vagrant up devstack`

__Devstack + Solum (mapped from local path)__

`SOLUM=~/dev/solum vagrant up devstack`

__Devstack + Solum + Docker__

`DOCKER=true vagrant up devstack`

__Devstack + Solum to Rackspace Cloud__

_experimental_

```
export OS_USERNAME=username
export OS_PASSWORD=api-key
export PUBLIC_KEY=/path/to/public.key
export PRIVATE_KEY=/path/to/private.key
vagrant up devstack --provider=rackspace
```

#### Using

```
vagrant ssh devstack
source /vagrant/openrc
nova list
```

#### Things worth knowing

* all default passwords etc are set to 'solum' for simplicity.
* some of the shell provisioning may not be idempotent,  so be careful running subsequent `vagrant provision`

### Support servers

In case you want to be able to run your own mysql/rabbit/python boxes rather than use
the built in devstack ones.  I have also included definitions to start up VMs for them.


#### All In One

```
vagrant up allinone
```

#### Seperate VMs

```
vagrant up db
vagrant up api
vagrant up git
```

#### Thigs worth knowing

* uses Berkshelf + Chef-solo to install apps and set users etc.   Wrapper recipes found in `recipes/`.

* from your local machine you can ssh into any of the VMs in the environment simply by running `vagrant ssh <hostname>`,  the vagrant user has passwordless sudo access.

* each service has a path in the local repo mapped to it.    `sql`, `web`, `git`.   These will get mapped to the `/vagrant` directory on each VM ... so `sql` becomes `/vagrant/sql`.   This allows you to work off the same set of files in both the local and the VMs.    the local solum dir is also mapped to /solum on the VMs.

* the user 'solum' is created on each VM, and a mysql database + user/pass is also created.   The values of theses are set in the `attributes/default.rb` file, and can be overrided in the the various JSON blobs in the Vagrantfile.

##### Rabbit MQ

http://127.0.0.1:15672 to access theRabbitMQ Control panel.

Default user/pass combo is solum/solum ( guest/guest also works )  and there are two default vhosts /solum1, /solum2.

There is no persistence or HA.

##### GIT

Git server/client is installed.   no setup beyond that.

##### MySQL

mysql username: root,  password:  solum.

Once we start building actual databases we should create a solum user and database as part of the install ( chef! ) and not use the root user.

##### API

Initially was Python+falcon,  but sounds like we'll be changing away from that.


## Testing ( The chef recipes )
    rvm 1.9.3       # if using rvm
    bundle install
    bundle exec berks install
    bundle exec strainer test
